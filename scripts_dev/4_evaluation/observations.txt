# Observations
## Network errors
If I run the command with the -d flag: docker-compose up -d graphdb_run_${policy}_${dataset} 
The error "network 4_evaluation_default is ambiguous (2 matches found on name)" 
does not occur

## Heap space
GraphDB is stacking up the heap with every "activated" repository
A repository becomes activated as soon as it is queried
If there is not enough free memory, the cache/buffer is used up (see top command in linux)

## ERROR in CBNG
Querying SPARQL endpoint http://Starvers:7200/repositories/cbng_bearb_day with query lookup_queries_p_q32_v2.txt
Following row cannot be removed: ['http://dbpedia.org/resource/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant', 'http://dbpedia.org/resource/Template:Infobox_war_faction']

Cause: Error in filter clause in string comparison in SPARQL query:
filter (str(?graph) <= "http://starvers_eval/v2/added" || str(?graph) <= "http://starvers_eval/v2/deleted")

Solution: change query template population to have a fixed count of digits in the version number
