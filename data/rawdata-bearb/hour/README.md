* Download the BEAR-B hour-datasets from the [BEAR webpage](https://aic.ai.wu.ac.at/qadlod/bear.html) (4 files in section 3.BEAR-B/description of the dataset/get the dataset) and copy them into ~/home/.BEAR/rawdata-bearb/hour. If you followed the steps, this directory should exist by now.
* Extract the datasets from their .gz packages. Also extract all sub .gz packages.
* Rename allData.nq to alldata.TB.nq.
* Create the alldata.TB_star.nts dataset by using the script provided [here](https://github.com/GreenfishK/BEAR/blob/master/scripts/build_tb_rdf_star_dataset.py). This script annotates the initial dataset (alldata.IC.nt/000001.nt) dataset with a creation and deletion timestamp. It furthermore annotates every triple in the changesets in alldata.CB.nt with proper creation and deletion timestamps. The result is a single dataset with all versions inside and can be imported into triple stores supporting RDF*, such as GraphDB, Stardog and Jena.
