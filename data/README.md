# Data Acquisition
Create a directory .BEAR in your home directory abd copy this data directory recursively into ~/.BEAR

## Datasets
See [here](https://github.com/GreenfishK/BEAR/blob/master/data/rawdata-bearb/hour/README.md)

Following datasets were not used from this framework:
* BEAR-A
* BEAR-B day
* BEAR-B instant
* BEAR-C

## Queries
Queries are already provided in the [queries_bearb](https://github.com/GreenfishK/BEAR/tree/master/data/queries_bearb) folder. 
See [readme](https://github.com/GreenfishK/BEAR/tree/master/data/queries_bearb/README.md)

## Scripts
We use bash scripts to create the database repositories and import data. The original scripts from the [OSTRICH/BEAR github page](https://github.com/rdfostrich/BEAR/tree/master/src/common/data-prepare-scripts) where taken and modified to fit our directory structure and scenarios we evaluated.
