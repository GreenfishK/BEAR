[Title]
BEAR-B_hourly timestamp-based RDF datasets

[Description]
BEAR-B_hourly timestamp-based RDF datasets with three different policies. All three datasets were computed from 1299 individual dbpedia copies as provided by the BEAR RDF archiving benchmark framework authors (https://aic.ai.wu.ac.at/qadlod/bear.html).

alldata.TB.nq: The timestamps are assigned via named graphs, format = .nq

tb_star_h:  timestamps via RDF* where we attach all the versioning metadata in a nested/hierarchical way to the data triple and avoiding redundancy this way, format = .ttl

tb_star_f: timstamps via RDF* where we have as many data triple - metadata triple pairs as there are metadata triples.; format = .ttl

Instructions how the datasets can be re-created from the original BEAR-B hourly dataset can be found here: https://github.com/GreenfishK/BEAR
