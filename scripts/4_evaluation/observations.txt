# Observations
## Network errors
If I run the command with the -d flag: docker-compose up -d graphdb_run_${policy}_${dataset} 
The error "network 4_evaluation_default is ambiguous (2 matches found on name)" 
does not occur

## Heap space
GraphDB is stacking up the heap with every "activated" repository
A repository becomes activated as soon as it is queried
If there is not enough free memory, the cache/buffer is used up (see top command in linux)

### Test run 1
Default graphdb configurations
