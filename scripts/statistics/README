## Computing dataset dynamicity statistics

### necessary scripts

1) sort.sh
THis script requires one input parameters pointing to the dataset directory.
The datasets can be either in *.nt or *.nt.gz format

execute
#> bash sort.sh D_DATA
For instance
#> bash sort.sh ~/data/opendata/

This generates under ~/data/opendata/sorted several files
*) data-* -> sorted nt file
*) subj-* -> unique subjects per snapshot
*) pred-* -> unique predicates per snapshot
*) obj-* -> unique objects per snapshot

2) python dynstats/diff.py
  *) this requires pandas, numpy and matplotlib to be installed.

The script computes the added and deleted stmts7subj/pred/obj for all snapshots.
In addition, it generates the dynamicity statistics and plots

Execute
python dynstats/diff.py -i sorted-data-dir -o folder to store stats and plots

#>python dynstats/diff.py -i ~/data/opendata/sorted -o ~/data/opendata/dynstats

this generated several output folders
extracted/ -> extracted static, added and deleted stmts/subj/pred/obj
plots/ -> plots as in the paper
stats/ -> csv files, containign the statistics for the different measures and snapshots
